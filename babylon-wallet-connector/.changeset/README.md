# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by
`@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or
single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the
full documentation for it
[in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this
project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

# Usage

```

3. Input Summary
4. Confirm changeset
5. Generated changeset is generated under .changeset dir
6. Edit the file in .changeset for further details
7. Commit change and push to Github
8. Github Actions will automatically create a new PR named `Version Packages`
9. After reviewing, merge the `Version Packages` PR on Github, the package
   version is then updated and published to npm.

Notes:

- The `Version Packages` is automatically updated with the latest changeset(s).
- The `Version Packages` will only update the package versions and publish to
  npm, not the actual code.
